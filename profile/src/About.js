            I know some when it comes to programming, I can understand the lesson, codes and the syntax
    if the one who is teaching me/us is good. I am a fast learner student but I also have a short term
    memory loss where I forgot everything that I have learned instatly in a short period of time.

            I have worked a lot of jobs before but most of them are not in line of the course that I am taking.
    I already worked as a crew worker in a street food or often called paresan, and until now I am working there
    as a crew. I Also worked as a factory worker where I am supervising a group of people and I also give them
    the materials, essentials and service that they need when they are doing their jobs.
